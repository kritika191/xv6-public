# Introduction

This project extends the XV6 operating system by implementing `strace`, a debugging utility that monitors and records the system calls made by a process. The implementation aims to enhance debugging capabilities, offering insights into how processes interact with the kernel.

## Features

- **Trace System Calls**: Enable or disable tracing on demand for individual processes.
- **Selective Tracing**: Use flags to focus on specific system calls or outcomes.
- **Child Process Tracing**: Trace system calls made by child processes.
- **Readable Output**: Enhanced output formatting for improved clarity.
- **Output to File**: Redirect tracing output to a specified file.

## Files added/modified

New files - 
    strace.c - is implemented, allowing users to trace system calls of running processes.
    child.c - is implemented, uses fork to spawn child processes.
    application.c - is implemented, produces unexpected behavior. 
Modified files - 
    sysfile.c - Added sys_trace to turn strace on/off, sys_dumptrace to dump previous strace logs, sys_handleflags to handle different flags, sys_writebuffer system call to collect strace output. Modified to handle logging of system call information.
    syscall.h, syscall.c, usys.s - Added definitions and bindings for the new system calls.
    Makefile - updated to include user programs.


### Building XV6 with Strace

1. Navigate to the XV6 directory: `cd xv6`
2. Build XV6 with strace support: `make`
3. Run xv6 - `make qemu-nox`

### Using Strace

Activate strace for a process:

```bash
strace on
```

Disable strace:

```bash 
strace off
```

Run a command with strace enabled: 

```bash
strace run [command]
```

Dump the most recent system calls:

```bash
strace dump
```

Write Trace Logs to a File (-o <filename>):

```bash
strace -o [filename.txt]
```

Filter by Specific System Call (-e <syscall>):

```bash
strace -o [syscall]
```

Trace Only Successful System Calls:

```bash
strace -s
```

Trace Only Failed System Calls:

```bash
strace -f
```

For additional options, see the command-line help:

```bash
strace --help
```
